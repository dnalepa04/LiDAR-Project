# LiDAR-Project
This is a repo for my 5990A Optoelectronics Final Project where my friend Nate Seibold and I built a crude LiDAR system. While this project uses an Arduino Metro Mini as its main Microcontroller, it requires python code and a matlab library to plot the radar scan. THe .ino file is for the arduino and the python code should be ran after the arduino code has been uploaded.
